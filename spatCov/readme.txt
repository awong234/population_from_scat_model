This folder contains datasets used for FITTING the model, which are designated by the "trimmed" monikers, and full datasets for prediction.

The repository does not contain these files due to file size restraints. The following files in the top-level contain all the covariates needed to run the models:

* `gridCovariates.Rdata`: all covariates formatted and values assigned to grid cells.
* `detectCovariates.Rdata`: all detection covariates required by model.
* `elevationBySite.Rdata`: elevation values assigned to observed grid cells 
* `habitatBySite.Rdata`
* `highwayDensityBySite.Rdata`
* `minRoadDensityBySite.Rdata`
* `scaleMetrics.Rdata`

Other than these, prediction will not be available, and files will be available upon request.
