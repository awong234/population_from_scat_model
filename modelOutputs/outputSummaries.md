# First run 2018-08-01

Priors were:

$\theta = \exp(\theta_{00})$ ; 
$\theta_{00} \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.01)$

$\lambda = \exp(\lambda_{0})$ ;
$\lambda_0 \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.01)$

$p_{00} \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$

This was deemed a little too informative by me, so I adjusted the priors in later runs after 0805.

Starting value was set only for the scat population vector, such that the initial value was the sum of all scats ever encountered; this must be minimally true to begin the analysis. No other parameters were set.

# New run 2018-08-06

Dana recommended longer adaptation period. Results are *much* more promising even after 10,000 iterations, as opposed to the previous 200,000, mixing much improved. Upon receiving this result, the chains have been set to update another $3e4$ iterations.

Priors were made more uninformative by changing:

$\theta = \exp(\theta_{00})$ ; 
$\theta_{00} \sim \text{Uniform}(-10, 5)$

$\lambda = \exp(\lambda_{0})$ ; 
$\lambda_{0} \sim \text{Uniform}(-10, 5)$

$\exp(-10)$ was deemed to be a sufficient lower bound. I am using exponentiated normal distribution because mean theta and lambda are expected to be very small numbers. The upper bound was chosen to be an impossibly large number. 

Starting values were set to the following:

`N[g,1,v]` was kept as the sum of all `rowSums(y[g,t,v])`; that is, all scats ever encountered; this a minimally true case for the algorithm to begin.
`theta0[g,t] = -6`, based on previous run of 200,000 iterations.
`lambda0[g,t] = -4`, based on previous run of 200,000 iterations.

Settings below:

`n.adapt = 10000`

`n.iter = 10000`

`n.burn = 1000`

## How many moose? 

If the daily defecation rate per 2500 m<sup>2</sup> is $\exp(-7.112) = 0.00081$, and the Adirondacks has an area of 2.4281E+10 m<sup>2</sup>, at a mean defecation rate of 13 per day, this evaluates to 609 moose, with an interval from 530 to 698 moose, for the period of time during which we sampled. Do note that precision is artificially high due to assumption of independence between grid cells, which will be addressed with a geostatistical covariance structure for spatial effect, or CAR structure.

Cut out all uninhabitable areas such as human development and water, and the interval is 

 464 - 534 - 612

 # Update to 2018-08-06 run ; 3e4 more iterations

 Running it further did not improve convergence of lambda and p. In fact, it seems to have made it worse.

 # New run with adaptation set to 100,000

Results aren't great, but update below improves things significantly
